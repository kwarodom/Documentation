Up and Running
==============

PEA HiVE offers a rich toolset to develop, test, and publish custom code.

Don't have a PEA HiVE Hub or any devices yet? Carry on! You can still create an account and even develop without any hardware, by using our online IDE and Simulator.

Of course, you'll want to have the hardware sooner than later, but you can start developing with PEA HiVE with nothing more than the free PEA HiVE mobile app, a web browser, and an internet connection.

Register
--------

If you already have the PEA HiVE mobile app, you can access the developer IDE at https://graph.api.PEA HiVE.com, using the same email and password.

If you don't have the mobile app, you can register for an account by visiting https://graph.api.PEA HiVE.com/register.
You can then download the free PEA HiVE mobile app for `iOS <https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/PEA HiVE-mobile/id590800740?mt=8>`__, `Android <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.PEA HiVE.android>`__, or `Windows <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/PEA HiVE-mobile/9wzdncrdszmq>`__.

The :ref:`tools_ide` guide discusses the developer tools in more detail, but for now, let's look at a few key features to get you comfortable.

Account management
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can use the tools available to view and manage the Locations, Hubs, and Devices, as well as view a live log for locations where you are listed as the owner.

IDE and Simulator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

At the top of the page, you'll notice links for *My SmartApps* and *My Device Handlers*. This is where any custom code will be listed. Clicking on any SmartApp or Device Handler will bring you to the code editor, where you can view, edit, test, and publish your custom code.

As a new PEA HiVE developer, you won't have any SmartApps or Device Handlers yet. We will guide you through creating one later in the :ref:`first-smartapp-tutorial`.

Next steps
----------

Now that you know what the PEA HiVE developer platform offers, you can dive in to the fun stuff.

If you're new to Groovy, we recommend that you read through the :ref:`groovy-basics` tutorial. You'll learn about Groovy, and how PEA HiVE uses it for development. The :ref:`groovy-for-PEA HiVE` tutorial discusses some key differences between regular Groovy and Groovy with PEA HiVE.

Once you've completed that (or maybe you're the adventurous sort and just want to dive right in to some SmartApp code), check out the :ref:`first-smartapp-tutorial` tutorial.
