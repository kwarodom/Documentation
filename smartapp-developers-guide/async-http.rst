=================================================
Making Asynchronous External HTTP Requests (Beta)
=================================================

.. include:: ../common/async-http-beta-note.txt

Overview
--------

SmartApps and Device Handlers may need to communicate with third party services via HTTP.
This can be accomplished using the various HTTP APIs such as ``httpGet()``, ``httpPost()``, ``httpPut()``, etc, as discussed in the :ref:`calling_web_services` documentation.
But, these APIs are synchronous in nature - the currently executing SmartApp or Device Handler waits for the response from the third party.
This synchronous execution blocks the current thread executing the SmartApp or Device Handler, and increases the likelihood of hitting the execution timeout.

To address these issues, we're releasing new APIs so SmartApps and Device Handlers can make HTTP requests *asynchronously*.
We specify the details of the request, along with the name of a method (that we must implement) to call with the response.
PEA HiVE will then execute the request, and then call the specified request handler method when the response is received.

With asynchronous HTTP requests, we're far less likely to encounter execution timeouts due to a slow third party service.

----

Quick example
-------------

Let's jump right in and look at an example asynchronous HTTP request.
Our example simply makes a ``GET`` request to the GitHub API, and logs the response.
Don't worry about the details yet, the rest of this documentation will cover it.

.. code-block:: groovy

    include 'asynchttp_v1'

    def initialize() {
        def params = [
            uri:  'https://api.github.com',
            contentType: 'application/json'
        ]
        def data = [key1: "hello world"]

        asynchttp_v1.get('responseHandlerMethod', params, data)
    }

    def responseHandlerMethod(response, data) {
        log.debug "got response data: ${response.getData()}"
        log.debug "data map passed to handler method is: $data"
    }

The first thing you may notice is the ``include`` directive.
This is a new feature in PEA HiVE that allows various APIs to be grouped together by their functionality.
Don't worry too much about it now, it is discussed in detail :ref:`below <include_statement>`.
For now, just think of it as a way to import a set of APIs that exist in a specific namespace - in this case, "``asynchttp_v1"``.

The code to make an asynchronous HTTP request is fairly straightforward.
We call ``asynchttp_v1.get()`` with the name of the method we want to be called with the response, a map of data that is used to build the request, and an optional map of data to pass on to the response handler.
The details of the request builder parameters are documented in the :ref:`async_http_configure_request` section.

We can then define an optional response handler method, which accepts the response of the request, as well as the optional data map we passed to the ``get()`` method. If none is provided the request will be made in a 'fire-and-forget' mode where the response will be discarded immediately after execution.
The details of handling the response are documented in the :ref:`async_http_response_handling` section.

----

Synchronous versus asynchronous
-------------------------------

The following diagrams illustrate the difference between making synchronous HTTP requests, and using the new asynchronous HTTP APIs.

*Synchronous HTTP Request Flow:*

.. image:: ../img/smartapps/sync-http-sequence.png
    :alt: Synchronous HTTP Request Flow

*Asynchronous HTTP Request Flow:*

.. image:: ../img/smartapps/async-http-sequence.png
    :alt: Asynchronous HTTP Request Flow

We can see from the above diagrams that a synchronous HTTP requests makes the requests, waits for the response, then processes the response, all in a single execution.

Asynchronous HTTP requests, on the other hand, handle the response in a *separate execution*.
The PEA HiVE platform makes the request, waits for the response, and then schedules a new SmartApp (or Device Handler) execution to call the specified response handler with the response.

It is important to note that these executions are not necessarily sequential.
Other executions may occur between making the request and receiving the response, either as a result of a scheduled execution or event callbacks.
See :ref:`async_http_when_to_use` for more information about using asynchronous versus synchronous HTTP requests.

Asynchronous requests are supported for the ``GET``, ``POST``, ``PUT``, ``DELETE``, ``HEAD``, and ``PATCH`` HTTP request methods.
A summary of the supported operations is documented :ref:`below <async_http_supported_methods>`.

----

.. _include_statement:

The include Statement
---------------------

All asynchronous HTTP APIs are namespaced in an object that can be included in the SmartApp or Device Handler using the ``include`` statement:

.. code-block:: groovy

    include 'asynchttp_v1'

``asynchttp_v1`` is then a reference to an object that the asynchronous HTTP APIs exist on:

.. code-block:: groovy

    include 'asynchttp_v1'

    def initialize() {
        asynchttp_v1.get([uri: 'https://api.github.com'], handler)
    }

    def handler(response, data) {
        // handle response
    }

The ``include`` statement should be placed at the top of the file.

.. note::

    The asynchronous HTTP APIs are the first feature to utilize this feature.

    The motivation for this feature is to allow a finer-grained control over the APIs available to SmartApps or Device Handlers, and avoid further polluting the global namespace.

    When using ``include()``, the PEA HiVE platform will attempt to find an internally registered API that matches the name provided.
    If one is found, an instance of the class representing that API will be injected into the SmartApp or Device Handler.
    If no API is found for the given name, an exception will be thrown and the SmartApp or Device Handler will fail to save.


----

.. _async_http_configure_request:

Configuring the request
-----------------------

All asynchronous HTTP request methods require, as the first argument, the name of the method to call with the response.
We also need to specify some information about the request, such as the URI, an optional path, URL query parameters, HTTP headers, and the content type of the request.
We do so by passing a map of parameters.
The table below lists the supported keys in the map.

================== ===========
Key                Description
================== ===========
uri (required)     Either a URI or URL of the endpoint to make a request from.
path               Request path that is merged with the URI.
query              Map of URL query parameters.
headers            Map of HTTP headers.
requestContentType The value of the ``Content-Type`` request header. Defaults to ``'application/json'``.
contentType        The value of the ``Accept`` request header. Defaults to the value of the ``requestContentType`` parameter if not specified.
body               The request body to send. Can be a string, or if the ``requestContentType`` is ``"application/json"``, a Map or List (will be serialized to JSON). Only valid for ``PUT``, ``POST``, ``DELETE``, and ``PATCH`` requests.
================== ===========

URI and path
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``uri`` is required for all asynchronous HTTP request methods.
If specified, the ``path`` will be merged with the URI:

.. code-block:: groovy

    // uri and path merged to form "https://someapi.com/some/path"
    def params = [
        uri: 'https://someapi.com',
        path: '/some/path'
    ]

Note that only publicly accessible (i.e., non-local) addresses can be used when making HTTP requests.
See the :ref:`async_http_limits` section below for more information.

Request headers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As you see in the above table, the request headers ``Content-Type`` and ``Accept`` will be added to every request.
If you need to set other request headers, specify them using the ``headers`` key in the parameters map:

.. code-block:: groovy

    def params = [
        uri: 'https://api.github.com',
        path: '/repos/PEA HiVECommunity/PEA HiVEPublic/events',
        headers: ['If-None-Match': 'c873e724d02caa124de0884535c32acb']
    ]
    asynchttp_v1.get('someHandlerMethod', params)

As configured above, the request would look like this:

.. code-block:: http

    GET /repos/PEA HiVECommunity/PEA HiVEPublic/events HTTP/1.1

    Host: api.github.com
    Content-Type: application/json
    Accept: application/json
    If-None-Match: c873e724d02caa124de0884535c32acb

Query parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

URL query parameters can be added to the request by specifying a map as the value for the ``query`` key:

.. code-block:: groovy

    include 'asynchttp_v1'

    def initialize() {
        // search for occurences of httpGet in the PEA HiVEPublic repo
        def params = [
            uri: 'https://api.github.com',
            path: '/search/code',
            query: [q: "httpGet+repo:PEA HiVECommunity/PEA HiVEPublic"],
            contentType: 'application/json'
        ]
        asynchttp_v1.get(processResponse, params)
    }

    def processResponse(response, data) { ... }


The request made given the code above would look like this:

.. code-block:: http

    GET /search/code?q=httpGet+repo:PEA HiVECommunity/PEA HiVEPublic HTTP/1.1

    Host: api.github.com
    Content-Type: application/json
    Accept: application/json

Request body
^^^^^^^^^^^^

HTTP request methods that may have a body can also specify a ``body`` in the parameters map.
The value of ``body`` can be a string, or if the ``requestContentType`` is ``"application/json"``, a Map or List (will be serialized to JSON).
The :ref:`async_http_ref_put`, :ref:`async_http_ref_post`, :ref:`async_http_ref_delete`, and :ref:`async_http_ref_patch` methods support the ``body`` option.

Here's an example making a ``POST`` request using a map for the body:

.. code-block:: groovy

    include 'asynchttp_v1'

    def initialize() {
        def params = [
            uri: 'https://someapi.com',
            path: '/some/path',
            body: [key1: 'value 1']
        ]
        asynchttp_v1.post(processResponse, params)
    }

    def processResponse(response, data) { ... }

Here's what the request looks like (note that the ``Content-Type`` and ``Accept`` headers are ``"application/json"`` by default):

.. code-block:: bash

    POST /some/path

    Host: someapi.com
    Content-Type: application/json
    Accept: application/json

    {"key1": "value 1"}

Here's an example making a ``PUT`` request using a string as the body:

.. code-block:: groovy

    include 'asynchttp_v1'

    def initialize() {
        def params = [
            uri: 'https://someapi.com',
            path: '/some/path',
            body: "<entity><name>test</name></entity>",
            requestContentType: "application/xml"
        ]
        asynchttp_v1.put(processResponse, params)
    }

    def processResponse(response, data) { ... }

And here's the request made by the above example:

.. code-block:: bash

    PUT /some/path

    Host: someapi.com
    Content-Type: application/xml
    Accept: application/xml

    <entity><name>test</name></entity>

----

.. _async_http_response_handling:

Handling the response
---------------------

Once PEA HiVE executes the request we specified and receives a response from the third party, the request handler method (if specified) will be called (in a new execution of the SmartApp or Device Handler).
It will be called with an instance of :ref:`AsyncResponse <async_http_response_ref>`, which allows us to get information about the response.

The response handler method must also accept a map of data that may have been specified in the request.
This can be useful for passing data between the time we create the request and when the response is received.
If no (optional) data was specified when making the request, the request handler method will be called with ``null`` for the second parameter.
We'll discuss this optional data parameter later in this documentation.

The signature of the response handler method should look like:

.. code-block:: groovy

    def someResponseHandler(response, data) {}

Response status code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We can get the response status code if we need to handle different possible response codes:

.. code-block:: groovy

    def responseHandler(response, data) {
        def status = response.status
        switch (status) {
            case 200:
                log.debug "200 returned"
                break
            case 304:
                log.debug "304 returned"
                break
            default:
                log.warn "no handling for response with status $status"
                break
        }
    }

Response headers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The AsyncResponse object contains all headers from the response as a map of key-value pairs (the return type is ``Map<String, String>``):

.. code-block:: groovy

    def responseHandler(response, data) {
        def headers = response.headers
        headers.each { header, value ->
            log.debug "$header: $value"
        }
        // can use array notation to get specific header values
        def etagHeader = response.headers['ETag']
    }

Error responses
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use the :ref:`async_response_ref_has_error` to check if the response has an error.
``hasError()`` will return true if any exception occurred during the request.

**Any non-2XX response is also considered an error.**

You can get any error messages using the :ref:`async_response_ref_get_error_message` method.

.. code-block:: groovy

    def responseHandler(response, data) {
        if (response.hasError()) {
            log.debug "response received error: ${response.getErrorMessage()}"
        }
    }

In the case of an error response, you can also get the response body using :ref:`async_response_ref_get_error_data`, :ref:`async_response_ref_get_error_json`, or :ref:`async_response_ref_get_error_xml`.
Note that these methods will throw an exception if called on a successful response.

.. code-block:: groovy

    def responseHandler(response, data) {
        if (response.hasError()) {
            log.debug "error response data: $response.errorData"
            try {
                // exception thrown if json cannot be parsed from response
                log.debug "error response json: $response.errorJson"
            } catch (e) {
                log.warn "error parsing json: $e"
            }
            try {
                // exception thrown if xml cannot be parsed from response
                log.debug "error response xml: $response.errorXml"
            } catch (e) {
                log.warn "error parsing xml: $e"
            }
        }
    }

JSON responses
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the response from a request is JSON, we can get a fully-formed JSONObject of the response using :ref:`async_response_ref_get_json`.
The example below illustrates getting the JSON response from a GitHub API call to get the occurrences of "httpGet" in the PEA HiVEPublic repository.

.. code-block:: groovy

    include 'asynchttp_v1'

    def initialize() {
        def params = [
            uri: 'https://api.github.com',
            path: '/search/code',
            query: [q: "httpGet+repo:PEA HiVECommunity/PEA HiVEPublic"]
        ]
        asynchttp_v1.get(processResponse, params)
    }

    def processResponse(response, data) {
        if (response.hasError()) {
            log.error "response has error: $response.errorMessage"
        } else {
            def results
            try {
                // json response already parsed into JSONElement object
                results = response.json
            } catch (e) {
                log.error "error parsing json from response: $e"
            }
            if (results) {
                def total = results?.total_count

                log.debug "there are $total occurences of httpGet in the PEA HiVEPublic repo"

                // for each item found, log the name of the file
                results?.items.each { log.debug "httpGet usage found in file $it.name" }
            } else {
                log.debug "did not get json results from response body: $response.data"
            }
        }
    }

``getJson()`` will throw an Exception if the response body cannot be parsed to JSON, if the request failed to get a response, or if the response status code is not 2XX.
See the :ref:`async_response_ref_get_json` reference documentation for more information.

XML responses
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Handling XML responses is similar to JSON - the XML is parsed into a data structure that we can use:

.. code-block:: groovy

    include 'asynchttp_v1'

    def initialize() {
      def params = [
          uri: 'https://httpbin.org',
            path: '/xml',
            requestContentType: 'application/xml'
        ]
        asynchttp_v1.get('xmlResultsHandler', params)
    }

    def xmlResultsHandler(response, data) {
        // results look like:
        // <slideshow title="Sample Slide Show" date="Date of publication" author="Yours Truly">
        //     <slide type="all">
        //         <title>Wake up to WonderWidgets!</title>
        //     </slide>
        // </slideshow>
        if (!response.hasError()) {
            def slideshow
            try {
                slideshow = response.xml
            } catch (e) {
                log.error "error parsing XML from response: $e"
            }
            if (slideshow) {
                log.debug "title: ${slideshow.slide.title.text()}" // -> Wake up to WonderWidgets!
            }
        } else {
            log.error "error making request: ${response.getErrorMessage()}"
        }
    }

Like ``getJson()``, ``getXml()`` throws an exception if the results cannot be parsed to XML from the response body.
See :ref:`async_response_ref_get_xml` for more information.

Getting the raw response
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If we want to get the raw response data, we can do that using :ref:`async_response_ref_get_data`.

.. code-block:: groovy

    def responseHandler(response, data) {
        log.debug "the raw response data is: $response.data"
    }

----

.. _passing_data_to_request_handler:

Passing data to the request handler
-----------------------------------

Given that the response for an asynchronous HTTP request is processed in a separate SmartApp or Device Handler execution, we may need a way to share data between when we make the request, and when the response handler is called.
Rather than store such data in :ref:`State <storing-data>`, we can pass a map of data to any of the asynchronous HTTP methods, and this will be be passed along to the response handler:

.. note::

    All response handler methods must accept a second parameter for the data map, even if no data is specified on the request.
    In that case, the value passed to the response handler will be ``null``.

    If your response handler does not accept the second parameter, a ``MethodMissingException`` error will be thrown when the platform tries to call your response handler.

.. code-block:: groovy

    include 'asynchttp_v1'

    def initialize() {
        def params = [uri: 'https://someapi.com']
        def data = [key1: "value 1", key2: "value 2"]
        asynchttp_v1.get(handler, params, data)
    }

    def handler(response, data) {
        // logs [key1: "value 1", key2: "value 2"]
        log.debug "data passed to response handler: $data"
    }

----

.. _async_http_supported_methods:

Available methods
-----------------

The following methods are available on the ``asynchttp_v1`` object.
The HTTP request method will match the name of the ``asynchttp_v1`` method--see the reference documentation for more details on each method.

========= ======
HTTP Verb Method
========= ======
GET       :ref:`asynchttp_v1.get(String callbackMethod, Map params, Map data = null) <async_http_ref_get>`
PUT       :ref:`asynchttp_v1.put(String callbackMethod, Map params, Map data = null) <async_http_ref_put>`

========= ======

.. _async_http_limits:

Host, timeout, response, and data size limits
---------------------------------------------

.. _async_http_blacklisting:

Host and IP address restrictions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Requests can only be made to publicly accessible hosts.
Remember that when executing an HTTP request, the request originates from the PEA HiVE platform (i.e., the PEA HiVE cloud), not from the hub itself.

Requests made to local or private hosts are not allowed, and will fail with a ``SecurityException``.

Request timeout limit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Requests will timeout after 40 seconds.
If the request timeout is hit, the response handler will be called and the response will have an error:

.. code-block:: groovy

    def responseHandler(response, data) {
        if (response.hasError()) {
            log.error "response has error: $response.errorMessage"
        }
    }

Response size limit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The current limit is 500,000 characters of response data.
This limit will be studied during the beta period, and may be adjusted as necessary.

When the limit is hit, the response body will be empty, but the response status will reflect the actual response status.
A warning message will be added to :ref:`async_response_ref_get_warning_messages` stating that the response size exceeded the limit.

Data size limit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The size of the data map that can be passed to the response handler is limited to 1000 characters when serialized to JSON.
If this limit is exceeded, an ``IllegalArgumentException`` will be thrown when making the request.

----

Using asynchronous HTTP in parent-child relationships
-----------------------------------------------------

When making an asynchronous HTTP request, the associated response handler method will be called on the SmartApp that made the request.
This may be obvious, but it is something to keep in mind if you are developing a parent-child relationship SmartApp or Device Handler.

For example, a child SmartApp or Device Handler can call a method on its parent that makes an asynchronous HTTP request, as long as the response handler also exists within the parent.

----

.. _async_http_when_to_use:

When to use asynchronous HTTP requests
--------------------------------------

Simply put, prefer asynchronous unless it is proven that synchronous is required.
Each case needs to be considered on its own, but there are some general cases where synchronous HTTP requests may be required:

- When the response is used in the UI, such as during the OAuth flow during install for cloud-to-cloud device integrations.
- When the response is returned immediately to other APIs, and those APIs cannot be refactored.

The next section discusses some strategies for refactoring synchronous HTTP requests to be asynchronous, and highlights some of the design changes that the asynchronous nature demand.

----

.. _async_http_refactoring:

Refactoring to asynchronous HTTP requests
-----------------------------------------

Find high-value opportunities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When considering if you should refactor synchronous HTTP requests to be asynchronous, look for high-value opportunities.
High-value can be defined as frequent, often scheduled, executions that make HTTP requests.

For example, a SmartApp that executes an HTTP request every five minutes can benefit tremendously from being refactored to use asynchronous HTTP.
On the other hand, a single synchronous HTTP request done only during install or in some other low-frequency occurence, may not benefit as much from being refactored to asynchronous, especially if such a refactoring is costly or risky.

Look for usages of synchronous HTTP requests that occur on schedules or other high-frequency occurences, and refactor those first.

Refactoring strategies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When refactoring synchronous HTTP requests to be asynchronous, we need to be sure that any code executed after the response has been received is moved to the response callback handler.
Consider the following synchronous HTTP example:

.. code-block:: groovy

    def initialize() {
        def results = getSomeData()
        log.debug "got results $results"
        doSomethingWithData(results)
    }

    def getSomeData() {
        def params = [
            uri: 'https://someapi.com',
            path: '/some/path'
        ]
        def results
        httpGet(params) { resp ->
            ...
            results = resp.data
        }
        return results
    }

    def doSomethingWithData(results) {
        // do something with the results data
    }

In the example above, the ``initialize()`` method (and all methods it calls) will execute in a *single execution*.
The execution will make the request, wait for the request to return a response, and then parse that response and do something with it.

To change the above example to use the asynchronous HTTP methods, we need to move all code that expects the results into the response handler.
We cannot simply update the ``getSomeData()`` method to use asynchronous HTTP, because the code in ``initialize()`` following the call to ``getSomeData()`` assumes that the response has been received.

Below is the updated code to use asynchronous HTTP requests.
Because the request is handled asynchronously and the response handler called in another execution, we move the logic that requires the response into the response handler.

.. code-block:: groovy

    include 'asynchttp_v1'

    def initialize() {
        getSomeData()
    }

    // execution 1: make the request
    def getSomeData() {
        def params = [
            uri: 'https://someapi.com',
            path: '/some/path'
        ]
        asynchttp_v1.get('responseHandler', params)
    }

    // execution 1 + n: handle the response
    def responseHandler(response, data) {
        def data = response.data
        log.debug "got data: $data"
        doSomethingWithData(data)
    }

    def doSomethingWithData(results) {
        // do something with the results data
    }
