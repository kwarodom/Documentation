1.Beginning: what happened at the beginning?
2.Middle: usually the highest point of action in the story.
3.Ending: how did everything finally work out?
Reading Rainbow Tip: Think about the most important events in the story. Be careful not to re-tell the whole story but give enough detail so that the plot makes sense to someone who hasnâ€™t read the book.
